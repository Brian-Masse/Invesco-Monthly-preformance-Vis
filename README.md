# Invesco-Monthly-preformance-Vis

For this project I worked with a portfolio manager from Invesco to create a series of data visualizations for a monthly report they were putting together. I have below the market beta visualization, but there will later be factors, and maturity visualizations.

## MARKET BETA

Following the theme ```Relationships Multivariate```, and considering the request of the employee, I used heat maps to relate several series of information across two visualizations. In these graphs, I kept the legend scales different, as although it makes the comparisons between the two graphs slightly harder, it makes each individual graph much more powerful (as if they share the same scale, the range of colors on the other is much closer together, and thus harder to read)
